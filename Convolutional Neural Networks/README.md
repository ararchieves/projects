# Introduction to CNNS

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the field of computer vision,
enabling machines to see and recognize images and videos with remarkable accuracy. CNNs are
a type of neural network specifically designed for image classification, object detection, and
image segmentation tasks. The key feature of CNNs is their ability to learn hierarchical
representations of visual data by using convolutional and pooling layers to extract features at
different scales.
